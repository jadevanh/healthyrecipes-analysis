# Introduction


Online recipe websites have now replaced recipe books as the mainstream (and free!) way to find cooking inspiration for one's next meal. The data set we will be working with is a compilation of recipes and reviews from a popular website, Food.com. This website provides recipes for a variety of cuisines, dating back 15 years (2008), and stopping in 2018. The data sets had 10 years worth of recipe ideas where we would like to investigate what authors considered to be a 'healthy' recipe.




The central question we would like to investigate is, **What recipes tend to be healthier?** We would like to use data analysis techniques to predict the




## Introduction to the dataset


The original data set consisted of two data sets which we have merged by the recipe `id` column. This data set has 234,429 rows and 17 columns. We have chosen the following 16 columns to be included in our DataFrame for analysis. 10 of such columns were not in the original data set, but a subset of the original data cleaned and created from extracting data. 
### Column Name and Descriptions:


- `id`: The 'id' column uniquely identifies the recipes on Food.com, used as the index column for our purposes.
- `submitted` : The 'submitted' column contains the date that the recipe was published by the creator.
- `minutes` : The 'minutes' column represents the number of minutes that it takes for a recipe to be made from start to end.
- `n_steps` : The 'n_steps' column is a record of the number of steps each recipe has, created by the author.
- `n_ingredients`: The 'n_steps' column is a record of the number of ingredients each recipe has.
- `n_rating` : The 'n_rating' column gives a 1-5 rating from users who have attempted to create a particular recipe. Recipes with a rating of '0' were not given a rating by the user who reviewed them.
- `avg_rating` : The 'avg_rating' column contains the mean rating for each particular recipe based on the reviews and ratings per recipe id. 
- `n_tags` : The 'n_tags' column is a record of the number of tags each recipe has that was put on the recipe by the author.
- `calories`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'calories' column records the self-reported number of calories for the recipe.
- `total fat`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'total fat' column records the PDV of total fat for the recipe.
- `sugar`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'sugar' column records the PDV of sugar for the recipe.
- `sodium`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'sodium' column records the PDV of sodium for the recipe.
- `saturated fat`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'saturated fat' column records the **author-inputted** PDV of saturated fat for the recipe.
- `carbohydrates`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'carbohydrates' column records the PDV of carbohydrates for the recipe.
- `year` : The 'year' column is a subset of the 'submitted‚Äô column. We extracted the year in order to get data about recipes on a per year basis.
- `healthy_tag` : The 'healthy_tag' column indicates '1' if there was a tag of "healthy" on the recipe or '0' for no tag.

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis




### Data Cleaning




---
To start the cleaning process, we merged the two data sets, 'interactions' and 'recipes' on the `id` column which links the reviews and ratings of recipes with the information about the recipe from the recipe dataset.


To follow, we have taken all recipes with rating '0', denoting that there was no rating for that particular interaction. Below are the distribution of recipes before and after the drop.


**INSERT HERE BEFORE AND AFTER DIST**


After this, we chose to create the column 'avg_rating` which distributes the number of


**we should impute the nan vals with the avg rating**


Then, we have decided to take the relevant columns from the dataset, dropping the following columns: `contributor_id`, `steps`, `description`, `user_id`, and `recipe_id`. We chose to save the irrelevant columns and kept the columns, `name`,`id`,`minutes`,`submitted`,`tags`,`nutrition`,`n_steps`,`n_ingredients`,`user_id`,`rating`, and `avg_rating`. These columns will aid in the data analysis.






Then, we have taken the tag column and created the `n_tags` column which is derived from the number of tags that an author puts on the post itself. In addition to this, we chose to split the nutrition column into the respective columns, `calorie`, `total fat`, `sugar`, `sodium`, `protein`, `saturated fat`, `carbohydrates`








- cutting off the number due to physical or real work significance -- we will put both of them


- show remove at 0 and show nan for ratings

This is a plot that describes the distributions of Calories in recipes that are tagged "Unhealthy" (red) vs "Healthy" (green).

# Framing a Prediction Problem


Our model will attempt to predict whether a recipe is Classified as healthy or unhealthy based on the nutritional data and the ingredients of the recipes in our dataset. The model used will be the Decision Tree Classifier.


At the time of prediction we know the PDV of Carbohydrates, Proteins, Total Fat, and the listed ingredients of the recipe.
