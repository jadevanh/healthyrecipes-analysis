# Introduction

Online recipe websites have now replaced recipe books as the mainstream (and free!) way to find cooking inpsiration for one's next meal. The data set we will be working with is a compiliation of recipes and reviews from a popular website, Food.com. This website provides recipies for a variety of cuisines, dating back 15 years (2008), and stopping in 2018. The data sets had 10 years worth of recipe idea where we would like to investigate what authors should be considered 'healthy' in their recipe. 


The central question we would like to investigate is, **what do recipies tend to be healthier?** We would like to use data analysis techniques to predict the 


## Introduction to the dataset

The original data set consisted of two data sets which we have merged by the recipe `id` column. This data set has 234,429 rows and 17 columns. We have chosen the following 16 columns to be included in our DataFrame for analysis. 10 of such columns were not in the original data set, but a subset of the original data cleaned and created from extracting data.  
### Column Name and Descriptions: 

- `id`: The 'id' column uniquely identifies the recipes on Food.com, used as the index column for our purposes. 
- `submitted` : The 'submitted' column contains the date that the recipe was published by the creator. 
- `minutes` : The 'minutes' column represents the number of minutes that it takes for a recipe to be made from start to end.
- `n_steps` : The 'n_steps' column is a record of the number of steps each recipes has, created by the author.
- `n_ingredients`: The 'n_steps' column is a record of the number of ingredients each recipes has.
- `n_rating` : The 'n_rating' column gives a 1-5 rating from users who have attempted to create a particular recipe. Recipes with a rating of '0' were not given a rating by the user who reviewed them.
- `avg_rating` : The 'avg_rating' column contains the mean rating for each particular recipe based on the reviews and ratings per recipe id.  
- `n_tags` : The 'n_tags' column is a record of the number of tags each recipes has that was put on the recipe by the author. 
- `calories`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'calories' column records the self repoted number of calories for the recipe.
- `total fat`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'total fat' column records the PDV of total fat for the recipe.
- `sugar`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'sugar' column records the PDV of sugar for the recipe.
- `sodium`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'sodium' column records the PDV of sodium for the recipe.
- `saturated fat`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'saturated fat' column records the **author-inputed** PDV of saturated fat for the recipe.
- `carbohydrates`: Subset of the original 'nutrition' column, the 'carbohydrates' column records the PDV of carbohydrates for the recipe. 
- `year` : The 'year' column is a subset of the 'submitted'column. We extracted the year in order to get data about recipes on a per year basis. 
- `healthy_tag` : The 'healthy_tag' column indicates '1' if there was a tag of "healthy" on the recipe or '0' for no tag. 

### Below are the first 5 rows of our cleaned DataFrame:

# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis


### Data Cleaning


--- 
To start the cleaning process, we merged the two data sets, 'interactions' and 'recipes' on the `id` column which links the reviews and ratings of recipes with the information about the recipe from the recipe dataset. 

To follow, we have taken all recipes with rating '0', denoting that there was no rating for that particular interaction. Below are the distribution of recipes before and after the drop. 

**INSERT HERE BEFORE AND AFTER DIST**

After this, we chose to create the column 'avg_rating` which distributes the avg of the ratings for each recipe

**we should impute the nan vals with the avg rating**

Then, we have decided to take the relevant columsn from the dataset, dropping the following columns: `contributor_id`, `steps`, `description`, `user_id`, and `recipe_id`. We chose to save the irrelevant columns and kept the columns, `name`,`id`,`minutes`,`submitted`,`tags`,`nutrition`,`n_steps`,`n_ingredients`,`user_id`,`rating`, and `avg_rating`. These columns will aid in the data analysis. 



Then, we have taken the tag column and create the `n_tags` columns with derived the infromation that 




- cutting off the number due to physical or real work significance -- we will put both of them

- show remove at 0 and show nan for ratings

## Univariate Analysis
For our univariate analysis, we explored the distributions of nutritional information that is often related to the health of a recipe.
Here we have histograms describing the distribution of total fats and sugars for all recipes. 
For many of our variables there are outliers, skewing the dating to be a wide range. We have chosen to crop these graphs in order to get a closer image of the distribtution of the graph.
We wanted to the distribtution of total fats, capping the x-axis at 200 (PDV) because this would mean the recipe has 200% more total than the typical daily intake. Values greater than this seemed not to make sense for the variable. We have attached both graphs for reference.

We also wanted to look at the distribtution of sugars. For the same reason as total fats, we have attached the full distribtution and a cut-off range of [0,200] for the sugar distribtution.

  src="assets/sugarDist.html"

Both plots are heavily right-skewed. For visualization purposes, we adjusted the ranges of both plots to be between 0-200.
We also plotted the medians of these distributions, as indicated by the red dotted line. The median for saturated fats is 21.0 PDV, and for sugars it is 23.0. This indicates that many of the listed recipes fall within typical daily value ranges for sugar and saturated fat composition.

## Bivariate Analysis
This is a plot that describles the distrivbutions of Calories in recipies that are tagged "Unhealthly" (red) vs "Healthy" (green). Note that due to a high number of outliers, we have cropped the range of the plot to be between 0 and 2000 calories, as that is typical daily intake.

We were also interested in the scatter plot between calories and carbohydrates. this gives us insight into how the two nurtients are related, and if there is any pattern when looking at the dots between healthy and unhealthy recipes based on these variables.

## Interesting Aggregates
Here we've aggregated recipes based on if they've been tagged 'healthy' or not, and are looking at the median nutritional information for each tag category.
We can see that recipes tagged 'healthy' have lower median calories, fats, sodium, and protein than those tagged 'unhealthy'.

|   `year` |   `healthy_tag` |
|-------:|--------------:|
|   2008 |      0.190893 |
|   2009 |      0.188007 |
|   2010 |      0.19753  |
|   2011 |      0.212201 |
|   2012 |      0.18315  |
|   2013 |      0.183017 |
|   2014 |      0.180172 |
|   2015 |      0.124183 |
|   2016 |      0.132353 |
|   2017 |      0.128472 |

# Framing a Prediction Problem
Our prediction problem is a binary classification problem. We are hoping to classify recipes as either 'healthy' or 'not healthy' based on their nutritional content and ingredients -- the response variable is `healthy_tag`. 
We chose this response variable because given the detailed information on the nutrients and ingredients of these recipes, we felt we could make insightful predictions about general recipe health based on that. 
When putting together a recipe, the user will have full information about the ingredients and thus nutritional content of the recipe, so it is fair game using predictors from these categories as a basis for whether it would be considered a healthy recipe.

We have decided to use ACCURACY OR F1 as our performance metric because EXPLAIN WHY

---
# Baseline Model
For our baseline model, we used Logistic Regression. Our features include `calories` and `saturated fat`, both of which are quantitative.

Our baseline model's ACCURACY OR F1 score is: 

We do not believe our current model is the best it can be, considering there is room to improve on our performance metric, and we are only using two features as our predictors. 
Our aim is to incorporate more features that could be indicative of the health of a recipe, such as specific ingredients, as well as other nutritional information so that our model can make more informed classifications.


---
# Final Model
In our final model, we included the following nutritional features: `sugar`, `sodium`, `protein`, `carbohydrates`. Note that we removed `calories` because components like protein and carbs contribute to the calorie count in a recipe, and we wanted to avoid multicollinearity.
We engineered a new feature, `prop saturated fat`, which is the proportion `saturated fat` in the recipe's `total fat`. We decided to incorporate this feature considering that `total fat` is a summation of all fats, healthy and unhealthy in a given recipe. We focused on this proportion because recipes that get their total fats from primarily saturated fats are probably mre unhealthy.
Lastly, we incorporated one-hot-encoded categorical features derived from `ingredients` into this model:
- `low_ingredients`
- `skim_ingredients`
- `reduced_ingredients`
- `organic_ingredients`
These features have a value of 1 if a recipe contains any ingredient that is considered to be low/reduced content, skim, or organic. We added this because aside from strictly numerical nutrition information, one can also determine how healthy a recipe based on the type of ingredients used.

After exploring many iterations of logistic regression models and decision trees, we ultimately used a Decision Tree for our final model as it performed better than our regression models. 
We tuned the hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV` and got the following optimal values:
- `max_depth` = 
- 
ADD OTHER HYPERPARAMS IDK WHAT THEY ARE

Our final model's ACCURACY OR F1 score is: 
This is an improvement from our baseline!

We have included visualization of our decision tree as well as a confusion matrix describing its performance.
